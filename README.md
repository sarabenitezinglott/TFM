## Introduction 

The duration of the cell cycle varies across different species. In the case of POMBE yeast, its cell cycle spans 8 hours, making it a preferred choice in numerous research laboratories. This preference stems not only from its distinctive cell cycle length but also from other resemblances it shares with human cells. Furthermore, it is crucial for us to ascertain the duration of its cell cycle and to accurately detect the specific stage at which each yeast cell is positioned. 

## Aims

Identify the cell stage of each yeast in the video and tally the number of cell divisions from the initial ones.
